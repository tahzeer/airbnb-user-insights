# Case Study: Airbnb User Insights
This repository contains code and analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb user data sourced from Stratascratch. The EDA process involves using tools such as Excel, Tableau, Python, etc to gain insights and visualize patterns in the dataset.
In addition to the code and analysis, this repository includes presentation slides summarizing the findings and recommending business strategies based on the EDA results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Stratascratch website and contains Airbnb United States user data until the FY2015. It includes various features related to user geo-data, behavior, preferences, and booking details.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- SciPy: Statistical analysis
- Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- sklearn: Machine learning toolkit (also applicable for further analysis)

## Future Work
- [ ] Extend the analysis by incorporating machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.
- [ ] Implement clustering algorithms to segment users and identify target groups for marketing strategies.
